# Angular First App

We are going over the [Angular.dev tutorial](https://angular.dev/tutorials/first-app-tutorial) for building a houses for rent app. 
  
## Running the App

```bash
npm install
npm start

# or
ng serve
```

## Tutorial Section 1: Setup

Recall, we need to have Node and Angular installed. Make sure to [install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) if you haven't already. Then you can install the Angular CLI. The lastest, which we are using for this tutorial is `21.1.2`.  
  
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@21.1.2
```

For this project, we create a new application using `ng new first-app`.  
  
And here we are!
